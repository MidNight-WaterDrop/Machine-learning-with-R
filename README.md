# Machine Learning with R

## Overview
This repository contains various machine learning projects implemented using **R**, covering classification, regression, time-series forecasting, and neural networks. Each project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

## Contents
### 1. Classification Models
- **CART Classification Model on Wine Quality** – Decision tree model to predict wine quality.
- **Heart Attack Prediction (C5.0, CART models)** – Predicting heart attack risk using classification models.
- **Heart Attack Prediction 2** – Alternative approach for heart attack classification.
- **Logistic Regression & CART Models** – Comparing different classification techniques.
- **Multinomial Logistic Regression on Wine Quality** – Multi-class classification approach.
- **Credit Default Analysis** – Analyzing credit risk using machine learning models.

### 2. Regression Models
- **Linear Regression Analysis on Wine Quality** – Examining factors influencing wine quality.
- **Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, and Loan Approval Prediction** – Applying regression and preprocessing techniques.

### 3. Time Series Forecasting
- **Time Series Analysis - Bike Demand Forecasting** – Predicting bike rentals using time-series models.
- **Online Retail Sales Forecasting** – Forecasting sales trends in e-commerce.

### 4. Neural Networks
- **Neural Networks on Credit Data** – Applying deep learning to credit risk assessment.

### 5. Data Exploration
- **Occupancy Data Exploration** – Analyzing occupancy sensor data for pattern recognition.

## Installation
Ensure you have R and the required packages installed:
```r
install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'caret', 'randomForest', 'nnet', 'forecast'))
```

## Usage
Each project contains an R script with code and explanations. Run the scripts in **RStudio** or using the R console.

## Future Enhancements
- Extend models with hyperparameter tuning.
- Implement additional deep learning techniques.
- Explore ensemble learning for improved predictions.
